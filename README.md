---Story---

There exists a Star of great power placed in its altar in the center of the universe.
It is called the "Galactic Star". It balances the spatial activity especially for planets with life on them.
Bowser steals the Galactic Star for his desire for an intergalactic empire. 
A Luma comes and request Mario's help from the Toads and builds a Starship for them that is powered on Silver Stars. 
Unfortunately, Silver Stars zoom out as a result of the Galactic Star's absence. 
One of the Toads manages to catch one Silver Star before it zoomed away which was enough to start the journey with the Starship. 
Silver Stars have spread around from all around space, and Mario's quest is to collect them, power up the engine of the Starship to go as far as it can before Mario would resume his galactic adventure on foot.
